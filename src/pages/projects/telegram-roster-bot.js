            <Heading1>Weekly Roster</Heading1>
            <Body>
              Since my housemates and I have already agreed that we will split
              the houseworks into two, and each housework would be taken up by a
              group of two taking turns repeatedly, so we have the following
              arrangement, every week:
            </Body>
            <List>
              <ul>
                <li>- Clean toilet: Me, Housemate-A</li>
                <li>- Clean house floor: Housemate-B, Housemate-C</li>
              </ul>
            </List>
            <Body>
              So the logic is simple, one of the weeks I and Housemate-B will
              form a pair to clean the toilet and house respectively, and the
              following week will be Housemate-A and Housemate-C's turns. This
              pattern will repeat indefinitely until we have a new arrangement.
            </Body>
            <Body>
              With the routine out of the way, now I just have to build it out.
              I first created a telegram bot through
              <Link link="https://t.me/botfather">
                <strong>@BotFather</strong>
              </Link>
              , a helper bot created by the telegram team to help developers
              create their own bot. Then I added the bot to my house's group
              chat. The role of the bot is to simply ping our group with that
              week's roster.
            </Body>
            <Image src={botFather} />
            <Heading1>Implementation</Heading1>
            <Body>
              As for the roster generation, I simple forked out a project by
              <Link link="https://github.com/richierich25/weather-bot.git">
                <strong>richierich25</strong>
              </Link>
              on Github where his project was to send the weather information
              every 15 minutes. I modify the code to fit my own use case.
              Basically, I have a nodejs main function which will get invoked
              whenever the file index.js gets executed. Inside the main
              function, is another function call to get the cleaner telegram
              username (hardcoded in an array) for the toilet and house floor.
              With the username returned, I simply generate a message from the
              template and fire the telegram's API call to send a message to our
              group through the bot.
            </Body>
            <Body>
              As this app is not running 24/7, we cannot save the state in this
              script. To easily solve that, I simply write the next person to a
              file (toilet.txt, house.txt) and retrieve it the next week the
              same script gets executed and updates the file with the next
              person.
            </Body>
            <Body>
              Lastly, to automatically trigger the script at the same time every
              week, I used
              <Link link="https://github.com/features/actions">
                <strong>Github Action</strong>
              </Link>
              to do the job. One caveat I noticed was that the time I received
              the message from the bot is not the time configured on Github
              Action. After a quick search online, it was probably due to a
              large number of jobs from other developers, causing the jobs to be
              processed later than it was supposed to be. Hence, use it with
              care if you need to run time-sensitive jobs with it.

              And that's basically it! A simple over-the-weekend project that
              solves my own need. Hope you enjoy reading this piece, thank you
